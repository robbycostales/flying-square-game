# BLUE BLINKING BLOCK BLAST

# Current State of Game
Features:
    * Avoid the gray blocks
    * Survive as long as possible to earn the most points
    * Collect coins to earn more points
        - from most valuable to least: Blue, Red, Yellow
    * Shoot stuff
        - sometimes will destroy the blocks to avoid
    * The game gets harder as time passes
        - the density of material increases as time goes on (just like school--fun, right?)

    * Deal gradual damage to blocks
